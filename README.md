## Introduction

This is an React Native (and Expo) app to take pictures, see and share them alongside their location.

## How to run the project

1. If you don't have **expo-cli** installed, check out this [link](https://docs.expo.io/) to get it. Also you should download the **Expo Go** app on your device.
2. Clone this repository and install dependencies

```js
// root folder
npm install
```

3. Run the next command on the _root folder_:

```js
// root folder
npm start
```

4. Now (after some waiting) a new broser tab should open with an QR code and a "copy to clipboard" link
5. **Scan that QR** code with the Expo Go app on your device (or copy that link if you're using an emulator)

## Notes

- My PC (Windows) can't run Android Studio, so my development enviroment is not optimal (beware of the bugs üêõ)
- To test and see my app I only have an Android phone, an iPad an a resource-economic emulator

## To-Do

- Make a better UI
- Solve sharing pictures problem on iPad
- Optimize CameraPreview screen
- Although the app is small, a better organization for the project would be good
